<h2>What is Jiao Xiang</h2>
<p>
    Jiao Xiang ('交想') means 'Co-Think', it is a moblie app that enable us to read papers and share ideas with other readers in a similar way with Medium. 
    It combines <strong>socialized and gamified elements</strong> into traditional reading experiences.

    Nowadays, people spend hours on swiping contents on their phones everyday. The reading experience is

    gamified elements can raise people's interest in the app. Jiao Xiang was designed to utilize those elements 
    to improve mobile reading experience.
