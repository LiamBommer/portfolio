            However, Snapchat is <strong>unavailable in China</strong> due to various reasons. How would the young adults in China 
            perceive Snapchat and would it be accepted in China is remained unanswered. 
        </p>
        <p>
            So we conducted a qualitative
            research on Chinese international students in America to find out their <strong>usage pattern an attitudes</strong> towards it.

                        We introduced the functions of Snapchat but not suggesting any usage.
                        They could use Snapchat in any way they want.

            The result from the last study differed from our expectation of Snapchat. 
            Snapchat might not easily achieve success in China due to the apps with similar functions in the market. 
            But we do not know if usage patterns and attitutes regarding Snapchat itself <strong>differ by nationality</strong>.
