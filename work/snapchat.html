<h2>Qualitative Research on Chinese Student Usage Pattern</h2>
<p>
    Snapchat is a popular social networking application among the young adults across the world.
    It has a lot of unique and funny features such as disappearing messages, filters, and Bitmoji.
</p>
<p>
    However, Snapchat is unavailable in China due to various reasons. How would the young adults in China 
    perceive Snapchat and would it be accepted in China is remained unanswered. So we conducted a qualitative
    research on Chinese international students in America to find out their usage pattern an attitudes towards it.
