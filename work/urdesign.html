            The interior design studio is called UR design, a startup company in Shenzhen, China. At the time, they used WeChat, 
            the most popular message app in China, to communicate with potential customers.

        <p>
            After several successful projects, they needed to promote themselves to a broader audience. A responsive website is a 
            perfect choice for demonstrating their projects.

                    As a design studiio, they prefer to use <strong>text and pictures</strong> to describe their projects.
                    According to the project-based situation, showcases are demonstrated in a blog-like style.

                    In each project, there is concise and well-arranged information beneth the title.
                    Considering some large scale projects, a floating navigation is placed on the right side.

                    Pictures are the main exhibition method for different space. However, too many pictures might
                    largely increase the length of the page. I used carousels to categorized pictures for the same space.

                    Considering the relatively small company size (less than 10) and the current condition in China, 
                    WeChat is the main communication method for them. The QR code on the page is the most convenient way 
                    to get contact in WeChat.
