<h2>An place for showcasing</h2>
<p>
    The interior design studio is called UR design, a startup company in Shenzhen, China. At the time, they used WeChat, 
    the most popular message app in China, to communicate with potential customers.

<p>
    After several successful projects, they needed to promote themselves to a broader audience. A responsive website is a 
    perfect choice for demonstrating their projects.

            As a design studiio, they prefer to use <strong>text and pictures</strong> to describe their projects.

            Pictures are the main exhibition method for different space. However, too many pictures might
             largely increase the length of the page. I used carousels to categorized pictures for the same space.

            Considering the relatively small company size (less than 10) and the current condition in China,

            to get contact in WeChat.
